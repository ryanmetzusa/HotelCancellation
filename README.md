# HotelCancellation

In this project, I used hotel cancellation data to create a predictive model to find out the likelihood of someone canceling their reservation at a hotel. I had to feature engineer in the final model and tested the model through various different algorithms, such as xgboost and randomforest. I included neural net for fun but obvious had weaker results.
